### Day 1: May 10, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Setup dev environment on a new laptop. Decided to re-try the 100 days of code challenge as a way of keeping myself more consistent. Will also use these log files as a sort of coding diary so that on days that are research-heavy (and thus don't have code to show for it), I still have a way of marking progress on GitHub. However, in order for the commits to count on GitHub, they must be made in a non-forked repo so I essentially copied the original 100-days-of-code repo as my own. I'll have to modify the instructions found throughout to fit this.

**Thoughts**: Reflecting on where I'm at in my career as well as where the job market is headed, I can't help but feel disappointed in myself for not being consistent in pursuing my goals. However, that's in the past and cannot be changed. All I can do is course-correct and get into the habit of continuous learning/tinkering. This seems to be the best way to future-proof myself regardless of where trends go.
