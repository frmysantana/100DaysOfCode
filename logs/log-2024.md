### Day 1: May 10, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Setup dev environment on a new laptop. Decided to re-try the 100 days of code challenge as a way of keeping myself more consistent. Will also use these log files as a sort of coding diary so that on days that are research-heavy (and thus don't have code to show for it), I still have a way of marking progress on GitHub. However, in order for the commits to count on GitHub, they must be made in a non-forked repo so I essentially copied the original 100-days-of-code repo as my own. I'll have to modify the instructions found throughout to fit this.

**Thoughts**: Reflecting on where I'm at in my career as well as where the job market is headed, I can't help but feel disappointed in myself for not being consistent in pursuing my goals. However, that's in the past and cannot be changed. All I can do is course-correct and get into the habit of continuous learning/tinkering. This seems to be the best way to future-proof myself regardless of where trends go.

### Day 3: May 13, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Was able to finish translating my JavaScript anagram solution into Python and have it working.

**Thoughts**: This week I am on vacation so I will probably focus on small coding/algorithm challenges in between vacation activities.

### Day 3: May 20, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Unfortunately while on vacation the WiFi wasn't good enough to do any significant coding/studying. Today I decided to start a small personal project about generating cheat meals at my favorite fast food restaurants that are bounded by a calorie limit. This is a tool that I could use on days where I run out of cooked food or am short on time and have to resort to fast food. I played around with some websraping scripts on ValTown and settled on something that can be used for now for an MVP. Also came up with a way of parsing the data I got from Taco Bell to only present the name and calories of an item.

**Thoughts**: This has been something in the back of my mind for quite a while and it feels good to finally start it.

### Day ?: May 29, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Continued the Udemy course "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass" by Colt Steele. The lectures I went through today were conceptual, however, so there is no code to show for it. I also have to go back through my git history and back-fill the days that I completed this challenge because I keep forgetting to write a quick blurb at the end of the day.
