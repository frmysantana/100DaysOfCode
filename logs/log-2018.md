### Day 1: January 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the Inventory Update script challenge on freeCodeCamp. For the foreseeable future, I will be focusing my 100DaysOfCode time to completing the Front-End Certificate on freeCodeCamp. There are 4 more advanced algorithms left, the portfolio project that I never submitted, and finally the 4 advanced projects.

**Thoughts**: The challenge was relatively easy. The only problem that I kept running into was that I had unknowingly passed one of the inventory arrays by reference to another variable. This caused the original array to be modified whenever I changed that variable, which then interferred with the for loops that I had set up to compare the two inventories.

### Day 2: January 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I began the "No Repeats Please" script challenge on freeCodeCamp. Unfortunately, I was not able to complete it by the end of the day, although my attempt is right for 6 out of the 9 test strings.

**Thoughts**: I was first intimidated by the thought of trying to find all permutations of a string for the challenge, but was able to reason my way through it. However, my methodology was off as shown by the script failing for all strings longer than 3 characters. I was able to figure out that my algorithm wasn't comprehensive and found out how I could get all permutations on paper by thinking of each character as a node in a tree. However, I'm not sure how to get a computer to do this for me.

### Day 3: January 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I was able to comlete the "No Repeats Please" script Challenge by researching permutation algorithms and implementing Heap's algorithm. I don't actually understand the algorithm, but it did its job.

**Thoughts**: I feel uncomfortable about implementing an algorithm that I don't actually understand.

### Day 4: January 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the "Make a Person" script challenge on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: It took me longer than expected because I misunderstood whether or not closures can be used to reset hard-coded variable values, but I eventually got it.

### Day 5: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the "Map the Debris" and "Pairwise" challenges on freeCodeCamp, thus finishing the Advanced Algorithms section. I also worked a bit on my portfolio design.

**Thoughts**: I'm glad to be moving on to the advanced projects.

### Day 6: January 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I started the Javascript Calculator project on freeCodeCamp. I completed the HTML and basic styling so that the page can be interpreted as a rudimentary calculator. I also set up the click event listeners on all of the elements and will be focusing the next day(s) to getting the page to be functional before I worry about better styling.

**Thoughts**: The initial anxiety I felt over not being sure how I'd complete this project gave way to excited experimentation as I started to code up the page. Felt great!

### Day 7: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed most of the functionality of the Javascript Calculator so that it compies with the freeCodeCamp User Stories. I may add in an oposite button (a button that returns the opposite sign of the last argument so that a positive number is returned as its negative and vice versa) some time in the future.

**Thoughts**: It felt great tackling this problem on the Javascript side and boosted my confidence that I do enjoy doing these sorts of things.

### Day 8: January 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I tried adding in some styling. I also wanted to change the layout of the top row of buttons and decided to add a button in order to move the '/' operation to the top row. However, the layout is now just off.

**Thoughts**: This made me realize that I've been spending so much time in JavaScript that my CSS is getting a bit too poor for my liking.

### Day 9: January 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I fixed the layout and styling issues and set up an event listener on the +/- button. Tomorrow I'll get it working, simplify the code, and add comments. By then the project should pretty much be done. 

**Thoughts**: I underestimated my CSS knowledge, for it actually didn't take that long to figure out the issues and fix them. I guess I was just a bit too tired last night to think straight.

### Day 10: January 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Yesterday was very hectic and busy, so I took a day off from coding. Today I finished the functionality of the Javascript Calculator and simplified and commented the code.

**Thoughts**: I'm feeling a bit tired, but happy that I have essentially finished this project. For the next few days, I'm going to focus on my portfolio site.

### Day 11: January 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I started coding my portfolio page.

**Thoughts**: I didn't start this until late in the day, so my brain was a bit foggy. As a result, I was a bit slow. Thankfully, slow and steady can still win the race.

### Day 12: January 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued with my website. I'm mainly trying to get the site to match the mobile design. Then I will match the desktop design and finally add the functionality.

**Thoughts**: I felt okay with the work I did today. It's some more progress. However, I may have to devote more than an hour per day to this later in the week if I'm going to have it completed by Sunday.

### Day 13: January 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished the code for the mobile version, I think. I write "I think", because so far I've only been testing the output on the browser on my laptop and changing the window size to what Bootstrap considers mobile size (less than 768 px). In a little bit, I'll check if it works on mobile. Tomorrow I'll do the tablet-and-up design (which is the desktop design), thus leaving me 2-3 days to flesh out the functionality and content.

Update: I just looked at the HTML preview of my site on mobile, and the layout worked!

**Thoughts**: I feel great (albiet pretty tired) for making steady progress on this!

### Day 14: January 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I just about finished all the styling for the tablet-and-up versions. Now I have to add the functionality and content.

**Thoughts**: Tired but satisfied with my progress.

**Link(s) to work**:<a href="https://github.com/frmysantana/Personal_Site/commit/b240bec393482c8de176637ee2afeb4c0fc66b99#diff-eacf331f0ffc35d4b482f1d15a887d3b">Updated HTML</a>. <a href="https://github.com/frmysantana/Personal_Site/commit/97469ac91cb0b250bb8cddee2332c890a43cdb07#diff-4e7bb40584b55a44f4657b188986bff4">Updated CSS</a>.

### Day 15: January 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I was mainly trying to get the contact form at the end of the page to be working. Not sure if it does, but I think it's time I move onto putting the rest of the functionality to the project images.

**Thoughts**: I think this feature may have to be added to a future version of my site, for I just started to realize that I would probabaly need to do some sort of validating and other security precautions that I don't know of right now.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A. I forgot to update github the day that I did this, so my code has changes reflecting other features.

### Day 16: January 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I was trying to confiure my desktop to have wordpress so that I could start learning that. Unfortunately, after getting Flywheel and trying to setup a default site to make sure that it is working, the page could not load. I'll have to troubleshoot this another time.

**Thoughts**: I feel a bit frustrated that Flywheel gave me a few issues, but that's probably a common theme in IT/Software Development, so I just have to become accustomed to this.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A.

### Day 17: January 21, 2018

**Today's Prgress**: I went back to my portfolio and played with jQuery to see if I can make each project image display a short description when the user clicks on it. I made some progress, but it's not complete yet, so I'll continue it tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: Once again, it feels strangely relaxing to work on this stuff, even if I don't completely figure something out in the timespace I had planned to.

**Link(s) to work**: <a href="https://github.com/frmysantana/Personal_Site/commit/1dd008a120be14407f954a2dfe24bd6295922090#diff-eacf331f0ffc35d4b482f1d15a887d3b">Updated HTML</a>. <a href="https://github.com/frmysantana/Personal_Site/commit/d0577a8e433a5f0d39660ecc9677ec9ca96a115a#diff-4e7bb40584b55a44f4657b188986bff4">Updated CSS</a>. <a href="https://github.com/frmysantana/Personal_Site/commit/257251732714d9ab1f4c49ca472f8e582bb560cc#diff-db8f629adc6c4c33f29613cfb71a6038">Updated JavaScript</a>. These updates also show the stuff I added to the form section when I was trying to get it to work.

### Day 18: January 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I improved the toggle feature on the portfolio. Now the other projects at least return once the selected project is clicked on again. I also added mock project descriptions onto the other projects, and dead links that will take the user to the htmlpreview version of the project once the final content is up. I have to find a way to store the original classes of each project so that the toggle feature returns the images to their original styling. Then I have to get the feature to work on mobile and find a way to choose the right code depending on the viewport width.

**Thoughts**: At first I felt pretty overwhelmed and lost, but by the end I felt pretty good about my chances to finish this portfolio page.

### Day 19: January 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: The toggle feature now works on both tablet-and-up and mobile versions. I also hid the labels from appearing on the page, since the original design has the labels inside the inputs. Lastly, I began ordering the CSS declarations, adding comments, and changing some of the names to be more descriptive.

**Thoughts**: After writing the progress that I made, I'm surprised that I was able to do this much in just an hour.

### Day 20: January 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added some transitions/jQuery animations so that the changes in layout when selecting/unselecting a project aren't instantaneous. However, it has led to a bug where changes in one layout may effect the other layout if one changes the screen size before setting everything back to normal.

**Thoughts**: I at first thought that adding animations/transitions would be too hard for me right now, but it didn't actually take that long. While the animations don't look that good (especially when selecting a project from the right column on the tablet-and-up layout), I feel that it still makes the page better, so I'm sticking with them. When I learn CSS animations in more depth, I'll definitely come back to this to improve them.

### Day 21: January 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I started adding in the final content to my portfolio. In order to do this, however, I also had to fix/take note of several issues on some of the projects that I wanted to put on it. I also was trying to fix the issue with changes in one layout breaking the other layout, but wasn't able to make much progress.

**Thoughts**: After being contacted by an employer that I applied to last week, I am far more motivated to complete this portfolio, so I feel confident that I'll get past these hurdles I'm currently facing.

### Day 22: January 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I figured out how to use MediaQueryList to get my portfolio to reload whenever the viewport crosses the 768px width boundary. This at least gets around the layout issue I struggled with yesterday. I also decided to get rid of the form element, as it didn't actually work. I'll add in a working form element as part of the next version of my site.

**Thoughts**: I feel really happy that I was able to get around this layout problem.

**Link(s) to work**: See tomorrow's links, for I forgot to update GitHub before continuing to change the code.

### Day 23: January 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I reorganized the project layout on the page so that it is easier to add projects in the future. I also finished alphabetizing the selectors and declarations in the styles.css file. Finally, I continued adding to the project descriptions.

**Thoughts**: I didn't feel like doing anything today, but I reminded myself that days like today are the most important when it comes to establishing a habit, thus willing myself to do at least some coding. To be frank, I think it was only about 45 minutes instead of the full hour, but at least it is something.

### Day 24: January 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I uploaded the rest of the projects and their descriptions into the HTML for the portfolio page. However, since changing the layout of the projects, I now have to tweek the javascript to work with this layout.

**Thoughts**: I think I caught the flu today, but I didn't let that get in my way! Almost done with the portfolio!

### Day 25: January 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I fixed the functionality issues that I was having before. After having a friend look over the portfolio page, there are some minor tweaks that he suggested, but I should be able to have the page completed and live on the web by tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: I'm feeling very happy that I'm almost done with this!

### Day 26: January 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: After some minor tweaks of my projects and their images, I finished the portfolio page, set it up as a github page and connected a domain name to it. For all intents and purposes, this is now my website!

**Thoughts**: Feels great to finally have this done!

The HTML page will change as I add more future projects to it, but for the sake of this project, this will be the final update that I put on this journal.

### Day 27: January 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started the Pomodoro Clock project. I just got the basic structure for the page and am planning to make it look like a digital clock face, with the adjustment buttons on the sides.

**Thoughts**: I almost didn't do any work today, but I made myself do it for the sake of the coding habit.

### Day 28: February 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I started adding functionality to the Pomodoro Clock today. I also added a stop button.

**Thoughts**: Another day where I didn't feel like coding. However, I got more into it as I actually started to work on the project.

### Day 29: February 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I got most of the functionality for the Pomodoro timer. The start and stop buttons now work, and the page transitions from the session timer to the break timer without any input from the user aside from responding to an alert. I also added more buttons so that the user can control the seconds portion of both the session and break times.

**Thoughts**: Today was one of those days where a little bit of thinking led to steady progress with no major roadblocks. I love these days!

### Day 30: February 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  I added some more labels  so that the button controls were more transparent, and the middle display now switches between the session timer and break timer once the start button is pressed.

**Thoughts**: I hit a massive roadblock today: once all of the JavaScript was pretty much done, I had no idea where I wanted to take this in terms of styling. I think I now see why it's recommended to design the final product first before you start coding.

### Day 31: February 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Because I felt directionless with where to take the Pomodoro page now, I spent today coming up with a design to strive for. It is very basic, but concrete enough that I think I can fill in the rest while restructuring the code to match the design.

**Thoughts**: As I was doing this, it struck me how I was coming up with a much more streamlined interface than what I had cobbled together when I skipped designing to go straight into coding. Now I REALLY see why it's suggested to spend some time on the design (even if it is rough) before you start coding. It's like brainstorming/outlining an essay before you start writing.

### Day 32: February 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I decided that since I would have to rewrite the code for the Pomodoro App anyway, I might as well do it using React as a way to demonstrate that I can use React.

**Thoughts**: Progress was a bit slow as I was remembering how React worked, but I was still able to make some.

### Day 33: February 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued writing the React version of the Pomodoro App. I got the handleAdd and handleSub functions to start working to modify the time for the session length. However, I got stuck trying to get the app to change which timer length to modify.

**Thoughts**: I feel like I didn't get very far today, but there were a few personal setbacks today. At least I did some stuff today.

### Day 34: February 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I figured out how to get the app to change which timer length to modify, and what unit to modify. I also got the add and minus buttons to work. Later on I should add some limits to how short/long each timer can be. Tomorrow I try to get the start and stop buttons to work, at which point then I should migrate the code from CodePen to my local files and break up the app into component files and add in Webpack, babel, and all those other software that I learned about.

**Thoughts**: Today felt more productive than yesterday, although I'm noticing that the code is getting very long for such little functionality. Most of this is due to copying and pasting the same code with minor tweaks and long if/else trees. I was wondering how I could DRY up the code and then remembered a JavaScript Design Patterns book. Maybe there'll be some useful tips in there.

### Day 35: February 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I began trying to make the start button work. Didn't get very far.

**Thoughts**: Today I had to take care of several personal matters, so I couldn't do much programming (only about 30 minutes), hence why I didn't get very far. Hopefully tomorrow I can do more.

### Day 36: February 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I got the buttons to work as I originally intended. This completes the basic functionality, so now I can import the code from CodePen and turn it into a web app with webpack, babel, sass, etc.

**Thoughts**: I'm quite pleased with my progress today, especially after barely being able to do anything yesterday.

### Day 37: February 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Up until now, the react code I had written was on CodePen.io, for they can easily set up babel. Since that script had completed most of the functionality of the app that I wanted, I decided it was time to take the code from codepen and save it locally, along with all needed dependencies to host the page. So I spent today setting up all the needed dependencies (webpack, babel, react, react-dom, babel's presets, sass and babel loaders for webpack, etc.) that I learned about from Andrew Mead's 'The Complete React Web Developer Course' on Udemy. I also split up the components into their own files.

**Thoughts**: Once again, I'm quite pleased with my progress today. Even though I didn't write much code, I was able to review dependency management for React and figure out some bugs that I had.

### Day 38: February 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I started styling the app. At first I had to spend some time figuring out why the sass styles I had started to add weren't reflected on the page. Eventually I realized it was because I had to import the styles on the app.js file. After that, I continued styling the page to match the mobile design I have. 

**Thoughts**: I feel good about today. I think I can have the styling done by tomorrow. After that, a bit more functionality has to be added before I can then focus on cleaning up the code and adding comments. Hopefully this project can be done by the end of the week. Then I have to figure out how to deploy it.

### Day 39: February 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I spent today adding styles to the Pomodoro App. The mobile view now looks pretty close to the design.

**Thoughts**: Usually I don't like styling things, but on this ocassion, it was actually kind of enjoyable.

**Link(s) to work**: Lots of files would have to be updated, so I will now only update them once every 2-3 days until I learn enough of Git to be able to do this more quickly.

### Day 40: February 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I spent today writing a function that would adjust the classes on two elements depending on how the user interacted with the app. I made some progress, but it's not done yet, so I'll be continuing that tomorrow. 

**Thoughts**: As I was researching how to complete this feature, I came across some other aspects and methods of React, so I now know that there are definitely other features to the framework/library that I have yet to work with. That's kind of exciting!

**Link(s) to work**: Too many to include.

### Day 41: February 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the function to adjust classes on two elements depending on how the user interacted with the app. I also found a way to style the inputs that represent the default settings when the page loads, so that the user is more aware of how the app is initially set up.

**Thoughts**: I'm feeling pleased with how the app is coming along.

### Days 42-44: February 16, 17, and 19, 2018

**Progress**: These days were very hectic, hence why I'm writing about the progress all at once. I was able to set and enforce limits to the timers, created custom input styles for both the selected and disabled states, tweaked when the alert announcing the end of a timer appeared, and adjusted some general styles on the Pomodoro App.

**Thoughts**: As stated before, these days were very busy, so I could only code for about 30 minutes each day, but I at least did something and for that I feel proud!

### Day 45: February 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I tried to include an audio element to sound an alarm when a timer ends. This only had limited success. As I was reading more about audio elements, I came across many cross-browser compatability issues, such as some browsers only using .ogg files instead of .mp3 files. I then remembered that there is a JavaScript library taht takes care of all (or at least most) of these issues for me: Howler.JS. Tomorrow I'll be trying that approach.

**Thoughts**: I was feeling a bit exasperated as I coded today due to the issues in my code quality becomming more apparent. Soon I'll have to refactor the functions in the PomodoroClock.js Component file because they are getting out of hand.

### Day 46: February 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I installed and started tinkering with HowlerJS. It's already working much better than the audio elements from yesterday, so I'll be sticking with it. Tomorrow I continue to adjust it.

**Thoughts**: Once again, it was a pretty busy day for me, but I'm happy that I still did some coding.

### Day 47: February 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished setting up Howler to work the way I wanted it too. I also tweaked the styling to look better across screen widths.

**Thoughts**: Tired, but satisfied.

### Days 48-50: February 23-25, 2018

**Progress**: These days were spent refactoring the code. At this point, the app does pretty much everything that I wanted it to do. However, the functions in the PomodoroClock.js compononent are absurdly long for no good reason, as most of it is repitition. So I've been trying to trim them down so that the code is more DRY.
  
**Thoughts**: At first I had no idea how I was going to do this, but then I started to notice little things that could be done, which then allowed to realize more general repitions that could be reduced with ternary expressions. Now I feel more confident that I can DRY the code up.

### Day 51: February 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I think I'm about done refactoring the handleAdd and handleSub methods of PomodoroClock.js. The new method I came up with, changeTime(), should be able to do the jobs of both handleAdd and handleSub, with the help of two arrays that contain two functions each. However, I have not tested it yet. That will be what I do tomorrow. During this time I have also been reading ProGit to start using Git to manage all of the file changes for these projects, so tomorrow I should be updating the actual repository. 

**Thoughts**: I feel very excited and proud of myself when I came up with my refactor! However, now I wonder if I abstracted it a bit too much.

### Day 52: February 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I debugged changeTime() so that the plus and minus buttons now work as they did before. The start button also begins the timer as it did before. Now I just have to refactor the portion that switched which timer is shown and alerts the user. I'm almost done with that as well. I have also begun to use Git to manage this project.

**Thoughts**: I feel pretty good that these refactors are moving along swimmingly. I am also glad that I can use Git for these projects, though I will be writing these log updates manually, at least until I figure out how to do them through Git.

### Day 53: February 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished refactoring the code that switched the displayed timer and alerted the user. However, I feel that the root component is still too long. The first thing I should do is comment the entire codebase, add in the Babel features that remove the need to bind a component's method's 'this' value to the component itself, and at that point explore if I can move the methods to one of the sub-components, or perhaps break them off into their own files.

**Thoughts**: While I'm still happy with the progress that I've made, I realize that I still have a ways to go before this project can be completed. That doesn't bother me much, though.

### Day 54: March 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I was contacted by a recruiting firm that puts its entry-level developers through an intensive training program. I was offered the chance for a technical interview if I learn the basics of Java, so I started doing that today. Consequently, I only had enough time to add comments to the PomodoroClock.js component. I'm still going to continue this project, but it will be at a slower pace.

**Thoughts**: I am thankful for this opportunity. Now I have to work hard to see if I can get accepted, or at least get some good interviewing experience.

### Day 55: March 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished commenting the rest of the files, added the transform-class-properties babel plugin to simplify the declaration of class properties and methods, and added a .gitignore file. After commiting those changes through git, it turns out that all of those changes can now be seen on one page on github, thus making it much easier to put a link to the work that I did today. I'm glad that I'm now using Git. 

**Thoughts**: Although its only a little bit of progress, it is still progress, so I can't be too disappointed in this.

### Day 56: March 4, 2018

**Today's progress**: Yesterday's changes broke the app, so the first things that I had to do was to fix it. After that was done, I refactored the root component so that it didn't need a constructor function, thanks to the transform-class-properties babel plugin.

**Thoughts**: After refactoring the code, the root component still seems too long, so the only thing I can do now is move some (or all) of the functions to their own javascript files and export them into the root component.

### Days 57 + 58: March 5 and 6, 2018

**Progress**: On these days, I separated changeTime and didTimeEnd methods into their own files to shorten the root componenets. They still need more adjusting, but the files at least communicate with each other and changeTime works as needed.

**Link to work**: <a href="https://github.com/frmysantana/Pomodoro/commit/a54df2e492780564ac7dabd417d9776a65d2e584#diff-caee6785a7d09b6183c46da1a868a55f"> Updated Pomodoro Repository</a>.

### Day 59: March 7, 2018

**Progress**: Today I got the didTimeEnd method to work with changeTime. The root component is now only about 110 lines long, so I will leave it at this length (at least for now).

**Thoughts**: I was first surprised that the function seemed to work so quickly. I just had to change the referenced variables to remove the 'this' from their name, and it worked. Then I remembered how JavaScript works with execution contexts and it all made sense.

### Day 60: March 8, 2018

**Progress**: Today I had to deal with an issue with Ubuntu. After it was fixed, I updated my portfolio page for a potential job interview.

### Day 61: March 9, 2018

**Progress**: Today I continued the Andrew Mead course. At this point, the Pomodoro App is practically finished; I just have to deploy it. So I've returned to the course to explore more React features and learn how to deploy it. Right now I'm going through the React-Router section.

### Days 62 + 63: March 10 & 11, 2018

**Progress**: On these days I finished the React-Router section and am half-way through the Redux section. The next sections are 'React with Redux', 'Testing Your Application', and finally 'Deploying Your Apps'. Starting tomorrow, I will host a repo keeping the files of these courses, as a way of demonstrating that these were not off days for me, but study days.

### Day 64: March 12, 2018

**Progress**: I created the repos and uploaded the files from the React course into a Courses repo here. I also went through about 5 videos in the Redux section, covering topics such as reducers, using combineReducers to handle mutiple reducers, and spread operators in ES6.

### Day 65: March 13, 2018

**Progress**: I went through 5 videos that showed how to create a selector that uses the props in one state prop to filter and sort the other state prop as well as seperating the redux components into their own files.

### Day 66: March 14, 2018

**Progress**: Today I only covered about 3 videos due to the challenges at the end of the videos taking me a long time to complete. Throughout those videos, though, I installed react-redux, set up the Provider component, and started setting up the expenses page. This includes creating several new components for the page, connecting them to the store through connect(), and setting up a filter field and remove buttons.

**Thoughts**: I forgot how dense this course's videos were. It is obviously going to take me much longer than I first thought to get through the material, but I'll complete it as soon as I can.

### Day 67: March 15, 2018

**Progress**: Today I went through 8 videos. Throughout these videos, I got the app to fully support creating new expenses and editing existing expenses. Support for redux dev tools was also added, as well as moment.js and react-dates to give the user a calendar widget to use for dates and to better work with dates programmatically. This marks the end of the 'React with Redux' section. Now just the 'Testing Your Application' and 'Deploying Your Apps' sections.

**Thoughts**: By the end of this section, I was reminded of how important it is to be able to research library/3rd-party features by reading their documentation, as the ecosystem of libraries/frameworks/useful tools is vast.

### Day 68: March 16, 2018

**Progress**: I went through 9 videos of the "Testing Your Application" section, throughout which I set up Jest, created tests for the Redux files, set up Enzyme and started testing the React components through snapshots.

**Thoughts**: Wow, this is a lot of information. I feel a bit overloaded, but as I practice the concepts they'll make a lot more sense.

### Day 69: March 17, 2018

**Progress**: I only went through 3 videos today. Through the course of these videos, I set up tests for NotFoundPage.js, ExpenseDashboardPage.js, ExpenseList.js, ExpenseListItem.js, and ExpenseForm.js, as well as a mock library for moment.js. Topics covered include taking snapshots of dynamic components, setting up mock libraries and how to simulate user interaction to test event handler functions.

**Thoughts**: I think that I might try to incorporate testing into my Pomodoro App, because I have been seeing testing skills being asked for in job applications.

### Day 70: March 18, 2018

**Progress**: It was a fairly busy day, so I only got through 2 videos. I updated ExpenseForm and AddExpensePage and learned about test spies and the mapDispatchToProps optional argument for Redux's connect function.

**Thoughts**:  Considering how long it's been taking me to go through this material, I am now not sure if I will implement tests on the Pomodoro App, especially since skills related to testing don't come up very often.

### Day 71: March 19, 2018

**Progress**: Finally finished the 'Testing Your Application' section! Tests for the last 2 components were created. The components themselves were also refactored a bit so that test spies could more easily be used (by using the mapDispatchToProps method to abstract the action generator calls).

**Thoughts**: I am feeling very happy that this section is done, for I am now one step closer to finishing the course and my app.

### Day 72: March 20, 2018

**Progress**: I deleted some of the dummy expenses in the app.js file and set up SSH keys for my laptop and github.

### Day 73: March 21, 2018

**Progress**: Today I got through 4 videos. Throughout the videos, I altered the webpack.config file to have both a production and development version, installed a plugin that creates a separate css file and css source map in the public directory, created an Express server file, and got the application ready to be deployed on Heroku. The deployment itself failed, but I'll figure out what's wrong with it tomorrow.

### Days 74-76: March 22-24

**Progress**: First I had to find a way to get the Expensify-app to deploy to Heroku. Turns out the problem was that the root of the git repository (Courses/) didn't have the package.json file needed for Heroku to configure and build the app, so I copied the app folder to outside of the Courses/ folder and set up a new repository that only pushes to Heroku. This let me build the app. After that, I went through about 2 more videos that showed me how to further optimize the production and development builds. They also showed me the development lifecycle for an app like Expensify by improving an existing feature in the app.

**Thoughts**: My progress was stymied these days by other personal responsibilities, but I am still working through this course, even if it is at a snail's pace.

### Day 77: March 25

**Progress**: I finished the deployment section of the react course and got the new feature to work. Now I am returning to the Pomodoro app to integrate what I've learned about testing and deployment. I got Jest and Enzyme configured, moved some functions around and started testing one of the imported functions as well as the Options component.

**Thoughts**: I'm glad I decided to integrate the testing material, for it turns out that there were some holes in my knowledge (and notes) when it came to installing all of the needed packages.

### Day 78: March 26, 2018

**Progress**: I finished testing the app today. I also removed all constructor function, converted the class methods into arrow functions, installed a babel plugin for the object spread operator, and replaced the '.' with a colon in the alert messages.

### Day 79: March 27, 2018

**Progress**:  Now with the testing done, I spent today optimizing the build for deployment and adding a server file. I also added a 'Designed by...' line.

### Days 80-82: March 28-March 30

**Progress**: I deployed the app but then noticed a small issue that I didn't think to code into the project (the app didn't keep track of which timer length the user was adjusting before they started the timer, so when the user stopped the timer, it always defaulted to selecting the 'session' timer). After adding that into the project, I also created a favicon for the page and fixed a variable name error that was causing several bugs.

### Days 83-96 : March 31 - April 12

**Progress**: There are still problems with the Pomodoro App, but I wanted to finish the React course, so these days were spent going through the 'Firebase 101', 'Firebase with Redux', 'Firebase Authentication', 'Styling Expensify', 'What Now?', and 'Upgrade Guides' sections. Now that the course is completed, I'm going back to the Pomodoro App to try and finish it before the end of this first round of 100 days.

### Day 97 & 98: April 13, 15, 2018

**Progress**: Fixed a decrementing issue where going from a time x:00 to (x-1):00 was outputting x:0-1 instead. Also refined when the error message is triggered and improved the format of the error message itself.
